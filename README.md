# Updated_swimmer_registration

This program is an updated version of my swimmer_registration.py.

Some functionalities of this program:
1. Sends an SMS **AND** Email confirmation to the user after they have registered themselves or another swimmer utilizing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Library and Google API.
2. I have connected this python program to an SQL database I have named swimmers.
3. Uses PostgreSQL and DBeaver to store swimmer data such as name, age, class registered, email and phone number.
4. Once the program ends, a table of all swimmers registered is displayed using tabulate library
